  <li>
    In a cup or small bowl, whisk together the eggs, mayonnaise and water using
    a fork. Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat. Pour in the eggs, and
    stir constantly as they cook. Remove the eggs to a plate when they are set,
    but still moist. Do not over cook. Never add salt or pepper until eggs are
    on plate, but these are also good without.
